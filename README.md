# Timezones
Bukkit/Paper Plugin that adds timezones to minecraft!

## Commands

Currently there is 1 command, `/timezone` or `/tz`
* You can run `/timezone disable` to disable timezones 
* You can run `/timezone enable` to enable timezones again
* You can run `/timezone version` to display what version you are currently using

Note: The plugin enables itself on server launch, no need to run timezone enable

## Plugin Dependencies

None :)

But I highly recommend [Chunky](https://github.com/pop4959/Chunky) 
and [Chunky Borders](https://github.com/pop4959/ChunkyBorder), both by
pop4959, so you can set the wrap to be like earth, thus making this
mod make sense. 

## Build

Run `./gradlew clean shadowjar`

## Unimplemented features that I would like to implement

* Latitude changing length of day
  * Blocked by lack of seasons/calendar system
* Better commands
  * Defining which world to enable and disable
  * Create command
